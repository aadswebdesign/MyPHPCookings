## JSNOTES

Presented here are snippets of my module based scripts folder that I use in my project where I'm working on!

All function/object names I'm using here exists within the scripts folder of my project.

Therefor, you have to translate them to your own disciplines to get those snippets to work.

Also, 'import' is as I have them in my project discipline and you have to deal with that yourself.

1. 21-12-2024  "getHyperlinkHandler".

Depedencies; FetchHandler/FetchStatusHandler.

A dry function to deal with async hyperlinks.

The **url** is where you **get** your data from.

The **callback function** is where you process that **data** for further use!

Yes, I might could have use **then()** too but I think this way is more handy and simpler to maintain!

2. 21-12-2024  "getDataHandler".

Depedencies; FetchHandler/FetchStatusHandler.

A dry function to deal with async data.

The **url** is where you **get** your data from.

The **callback function** is where you process that **data** for further use!
